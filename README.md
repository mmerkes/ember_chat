#Welcome the Ember Chat!

Basically, I'm playing around with Ember.js and Socket.io to see
if I can get them to play nicely together. The server is Node.js, 
of course, and the extent of the functionality is still to be determined.

Thanks to authors Mike Cantelon, Marc Harter, T.J. Holowaychuk and Nathan Rajlich
for writing an excellent book on Node.js. Their example of
writing a chat server really helped me understand key
Socket.io concepts. Although this chat server was written from
scratch and the the code differs greatly, some of the ideas
were learned through running through their tutorial.
